    "        Question: What is the role of reinforcement learning in AI?\n",
    "        Answer: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables AI agents to learn optimal behaviors through trial and error by maximizing cumulative rewards from environment interactions. It is pivotal in sequential decision-making tasks like game playing (e.g., AlphaGo), robotics, and autonomous systems. RL algorithms iteratively improve policies, balancing exploration and exploitation [Sutton & Barto, 2018; corpus: 2259]. Recent advances integrate deep learning for complex environments [Arulkumaran et al., 2020; corpus: 8403].\n",

    "        Example 3:\n",
    "        Question: How effective are BERT embeddings for document retrieval?\n",
    "        Answer: BBERT embeddings enhance document retrieval by capturing contextual semantics, outperforming traditional methods like TF-IDF in understanding query-document relevance. However, their effectiveness depends on fine-tuning for specific tasks and computational resources. BERT’s fixed-length inputs can truncate long documents, limiting full-context use. Hybrid approaches (e.g., BERT with BM25) often yield optimal results [Nogueira et al., 2019; corpus: 8596]. Domain adaptation further boosts performance [Zhan et al., 2021; corpus: 23884].\n"
